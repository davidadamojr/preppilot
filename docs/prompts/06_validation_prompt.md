**Goal:** Ensure the MVP meets success criteria.

**Prompt:**

Run validation tests to confirm product-market readiness.

### Success Metrics
- 70% of users who miss a prep complete an adapted meal within 48 hours.
- >80% of generated meals are rated “easy to execute.”
- <10% ingredient waste rate among testers.

### Validation Steps
1. Simulate 10 beta users with low-histamine constraints.
2. Log skipped vs. adapted meal outcomes.
3. Collect qualitative feedback on adaptation helpfulness.
4. Adjust prep-sequencing algorithm based on results.

### Post-MVP Next Steps
- Expand to FODMAP and fructose-free diets.
- Learn user prep rhythms (average time per step).
- Add LLM-based recipe generator constrained by rules.
